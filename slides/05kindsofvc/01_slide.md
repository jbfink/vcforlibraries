# There are two main types of modern version control #
## Centralized and Decentralized ##

!SLIDE bullets incremental
# Centralized #
* depends on a central server
* client checkouts typically contain the most recent version only
* restricted in workflow by design
* think -- web server, web client

!SLIDE bullets incremental
# Decentralized #
* Has no "authoritative" server by default
* Every checkout contains the entire history of the project
* workflow can be just about anything
* no single point of failure, unless there is *only* a single point
* think -- peer to peer
