Version Control for Libraries
=============================

Library Technology Conference March 16-17, 2011, Macalester College, St. Paul, MN
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm extremely psyched to have the opportunity to go to Macalester College's
excellent Library Technology Conference for the second year running. I had such a
great experience doing [the last presentation](http://www.slideshare.net/adr/im-not-here-im-there-using-a-local-instant-messaging-service-in-your-library) that I jumped at
the chance of doing another one. Since this one's on version control, it seemed only
natural to do it soup-to-nuts as a git/github thing.
